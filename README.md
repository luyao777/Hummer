# Hummer

This is my latest game engine project. In this project, I will build a complete game engine from scratch and keep it updated. This project will follow the [video](https://thecherno.com/engine/) and [code](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), modify it according to my idea, and you will see how to implement such a game engine in a mac system (or linux system).

I named it hummer. This is actually my C++ practice project. :joy:
